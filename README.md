##Objective:
Association Rule Mining as the name suggests, association rules are simple 
If/Then statements that help discover relationships between seemingly 
independent relational databases or other data repositories.
Most machine learning algorithms work with numeric datasets and hence tend to 
be mathematical. However, association rule mining is suitable for non-numeric, 
categorical data and requires just a little bit more than simple counting.
Association rule mining is a procedure which aims to observe frequently 
occurring patterns, correlations, or associations from datasets found in various 
kinds of databases such as relational databases, transactional databases, and 
other forms of repositories.
Some of the areas where Association Rule Mining has helped a lot are:
1.Market Basket Analysis (MBA, often used synonymous to Association Rule 
Mining)
2.Medical Diagnosis
3.Census Data
4.Protein Sequence
##Conclusion/Reccomendations:
We apply a APRIORI ALGORITHM to a top rated movies dataset. The technique 
does not provide a recommendation in a fine-grained user level, but it does 
enable us to investigate an underlying relationship within the movies. We can 
utilize such findings to construct a new marketing campaign, research customerâ€™s
behavior, or make a product suggestion.
After applying various metrics it was seen the that the most successful genre was 
a combination of Crime, Thriller and Drama.
As a movie maker, one could try to explore other than these genres, which are not 
explored much. The makers can either earn by making more movies of such 
genres that are preferred by the masses or they could try and bring innovative 
ideas ,story, screenplay and direction to add the currently not so liked genres to 
the liking list of the audiences
